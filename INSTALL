TO BUILD:
---------
This program has not yet been "autoconfiscated," for now
just type "make"

The executable "gneutronica" should be produced.



TO INSTALL:
-----------
Run "make install" as root.

This copies gneutronica to /usr/local/bin, and copies
the drumkit files to /usr/local/share/gneutronica/drumkits
and documenation files to /usr/local/share/gneutronica/documentation,
and an icon file to /usr/share/pixmaps, (if that directory exists)



TO UNINSTALL:
-------------
Run "make uninstall" will remove /usr/local/bin/gneutronica and
/usr/local/share/gneutronica, and essentially undoes all the stuff 
that "make install" does.
