Known bugs:

* Selecting "Cancel" or the (X) button to kill the window in any of the file
  dialogs will cause the program to crash subsequently whenever that file
  dialog is made to pop up again (e.g. If you 'Save', but cancel, then
  'Save' again, the second save will crash the program immediately.
  THIS BUG FIXED in v. 0.21
