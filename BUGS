Known bugs:

* Selecting "Cancel" or the (X) button to kill the window in any of the file
  dialogs will cause the program to crash subsequently whenever that file
  dialog is made to pop up again (e.g. If you 'Save', but cancel, then
  'Save' again, the second save will crash the program immediately.
  THIS BUG FIXED in v. 0.21

* Getting this message... not sure what it means:
	(gneutronica:6635): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkmenu.c: line 1588 
	(gtk_menu_set_accel_path): assertion 
	`accel_path[0] == '<' && strchr (accel_path, '/')' failed
  Started happenning when I put in the pull down menu code.  If you know
  how to fix it, let me know.  <smcameron@users.sourceforge.net>

* It appears that "rushing" (using negative drag) on an instrument
  does not actually work.

* I have occasionially seen notes get dropped when multiple patterns are
  played at the same time in the arrangement window.  Reselecting the 
  patterns in a different order seems to avoid it sometimes.
