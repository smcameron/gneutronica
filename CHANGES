gneutronica-0.1.tar.gz 

	* Initial release

gneutronica-0.2.tar.gz

	* Can now edit and save drum kits
	* Can now play selected measures, in addition to 
          individual patterns or whole songs.

gneutronica 0.21:

	* Fixed the bug that caused using the "Cancel" button or "X" button
	  on any of the file dialogs to cause the program to crash whenever
	  any of those file dialogs were told to reappear onscreen.

	* Added some UI stuff for doing drag/rushing of individual instruments,
	  however, they don't actually do anything yet.

	* Added some infrastructure for accessing different device types.  
	  I'm still unclear on what the "correct" way of talking to midi devices
	  is, whether through /dev/sequencer, or /dev/snd/midi* is.  For now,
	  since /dev/snd/midi* is working for me, that's what I'm sticking with.
	  If you know something about all this, feel free to send me a patch.

gneutronica 0.22

	* Added man page and gneutronica icon and Makefile (un)installs these 
	* Added "snap to grid" checkbox which, when unchecked, allows arbitrary 
	  placement of notes on the time axis.
	* Added an about window.
	* Implemented dragging/rushing per instrument per pattern.
	* Now indicates transport location during playback. 

gneutronica 0.23
	* Now, if drumkit file isn't loaded successfully, the program continues
	  with a generic default instead of bailing out.  Fixed default to be  
	  general midi kit and not yamaha motif kit.
	* Reorganized some of the code, pulled out variable and type decls into
	  gneutronica.h using the GLOBAL/INIT trick from the book Graphics Gems.
	  Made a home for old file format reading code that's separate from the
	  gneutronica.c
	* Added a proper set of pulldown menus, got rid of save/load buttons.

gneutronica 0.24
	* Added button to each instrument to clear that instrument's notes from 
	  the current pattern.

	* Added capability to import the patterns from another song.

	* Added "volume zoom" capability

gneutronica 0.25

	* Added ability to export song to MIDI file.

gneutronica 0.26

	* Fixed problem that if all measures were deleted, segfault could result
	  (kind of a hack, just prevented user from deleting all measures.)

	* Fixed a memory leak

	* Now can insert and delete patterns.

gneutronica 0.27

	* Can now remap a song or a pattern's drumkit to another drumkit using 
	  General MIDI as a lowest common denominator.  (Works, sorta kinda... 
	  better than nothing.)

	* added experimental user interface changes automag and autocrunch.
	  They don't really work as well as I was hoping they would, esp.
	  autocrunch.  Automag by itself is alright.

	* Deleting and inserting measures now adjusts tempo changes 
	  accordingly. (bugfix)

	* Starts off with windows maximized.  (Use alt-tab to switch between windows, 
	  or whatever method your window manager provides, or unmaximize, or start 
	  it with the -m option if you don't like the default maximizing behavior.)

	* Some hotkey support. 'q' quits.

gneutronica 0.28

	* Added hotkeys 'c', 'p', 'x', 'P', and 'X' in the pattern window.
	  These are all designed for the purpose of changing an instrument.
          (e.g. you like the pattern, but want to try a different snare drum
           sound.  These are best used with automag and volume zoom enabled
           (leave autocrunch turned off.))

	  c - marks current instrument for copying.
	  p - (lowercase p) copies (pastes) previously marked instrument's hits
              into current instrument in the current pattern.
	  x - (lowercase x) clears current instrument (like the 'Clear' 
              button by each instrument).
	  P - (shift-p) copies (pastes) previously marked instruments hits
              into current instrument FOR THE ENTIRE SONG.
	  X - (shift-x) clears current instrument FOR THE ENTIRE SONG.

	* Added documentation about using alsa-virmidi to control softsynths.

gneutronica 0.29

	* Added "scramble" feature
	* Added ability to cram extra space into a measure at the
	  beginning or at the end.
 	* Added ability to remove a fraction of a measure, either
 	  from the beginning, or from the end.
	* Added "Select" button to pattern window so you don't have
	  to switch over to the arranger window just to select a
	  pattern for copying.

gneutronica 0.30

	* You can now import ASCII drum tablature either from a file or
	  by cutting and pasting with the mouse.

gneutronica 0.31

	* Minor changes to drum tab reading code
	* Allow looping of playback of patterns
	* Added a "recording mode" which records from MIDI input device
          (e.g. Akai MPD16 drumpad through Midiman MIDI to USB converter
	  is the only device I've tried)
	* Add French translations (very bad machine-made translations, but the
	  code to handle different languages is sort of there now.)
	* change some widgets background color to white.
	* Now you can activate/deactivate or select multiple measures in
	  the arranger window by clicking and dragging with the first or
	  third mouse button in the pattern area.

gneutronica 0.32

	* Added drumkit definition for a Roland TR808 sound font.
	* Bugfix: inserted measures might get bogus tempo -- fixed.
	* MIDI output method abstraction... two instantiations raw
	  MIDI and ALSA sequencer.
	* Now uses ALSA sequencer interface instead of raw MIDI.
	* Bugfix: Scramble function had overflow bug that caused it to
	  be non-random. Fixed.
	* Combined Pattern Editor widnow and Arrangement Editor window into
	  a single window by putting them both into tabs in a Gtk notebook.
	* Output is assignable to up to 16 ALSA sequencer ports ("tracks")
	  on a per-pattern basis to allow routing different patterns to
	  different MIDI devices or softsynths.
	* Now there is a rudimentary melodic sequencer as well as a
	  percussion sequencer.
	* Arrangement editor marks every 8 measures instead of every 10

gneutronica 0.33

	* Scramble button did not adjust noteoff times -- fixed.
	* Shortened names of buttons at bottom of pattern window.
	* Added a way to transpose melodic patterns up or down.
	* Made the piano notes a little wider
	* Added ability to mute MIDI channels and tracks (in case
	  you want to record those parts separately so they may be
	  mixed independently later.)
	* Fixed remapping of drumkits to not screw up melodic patterns
	* Fuxed bug that freshly loaded songs didn't have noteoff data
	* Made noteoff get sent when program quits.
