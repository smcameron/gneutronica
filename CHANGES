gneutronica-0.1.tar.gz 

	* Initial release

gneutronica-0.2.tar.gz

	* Can now edit and save drum kits
	* Can now play selected measures, in addition to 
          individual patterns or whole songs.

gneutronica 0.21:

	* Fixed the bug that caused using the "Cancel" button or "X" button
	  on any of the file dialogs to cause the program to crash whenever
	  any of those file dialogs were told to reappear onscreen.

	* Added some UI stuff for doing drag/rushing of individual instruments,
	  however, they don't actually do anything yet.

	* Added some infrastructure for accessing different device types.  
	  I'm still unclear on what the "correct" way of talking to midi devices
	  is, whether through /dev/sequencer, or /dev/snd/midi* is.  For now,
	  since /dev/snd/midi* is working for me, that's what I'm sticking with.
	  If you know something about all this, feel free to send me a patch.

gneutronica 0.22

	* Added man page and gneutronica icon and Makefile (un)installs these 
	* Added "snap to grid" checkbox which, when unchecked, allows arbitrary 
	  placement of notes on the time axis.
	* Added an about window.
	* Implemented dragging/rushing per instrument per pattern.
	* Now indicates transport location during playback. 

gneutronica 0.23
	* Now, if drumkit file isn't loaded successfully, the program continues
	  with a generic default instead of bailing out.  Fixed default to be  
	  general midi kit and not yamaha motif kit.
	* Reorganized some of the code, pulled out variable and type decls into
	  gneutronica.h using the GLOBAL/INIT trick from the book Graphics Gems.
	  Made a home for old file format reading code that's separate from the
	  gneutronica.c
	* Added a proper set of pulldown menus, got rid of save/load buttons.

gneutronica 0.24
	* Added button to each instrument to clear that instrument's notes from 
	  the current pattern.

	* Added capability to import the patterns from another song.

	* Added "volume zoom" capability

gneutronica 0.25

	* Added ability to export song to MIDI file.
