* Would be nice to be able to make a pattern with a large no. of divisions
  so you can compose a drum pattern to go with, say, a guitar riff of
  an unknown number of beats (too lazy to count) and then when you've 
  got it down and there's some extra unused space on the right hand 
  side of the measure which is unused...  Well it would be nice if there
  was a way shorten the measure by truncating some portion off the RHS,
  so that the composition of the drums automatically counts the beats,
  instead of having to count the beats ahead of time, and THEN compose
  the drum beats, or, only too late find out you counted wrong, and have
  to redo it in another pattern that's divided (you hope) correctly.

* Need to have "Save" and "Save As" actually behave differntly, and
  Save As needs to warn you if you're overwriting an existing file.  
  In general, there are some error conditions which are handled by 
  printfs, etc. which need error dialog windows.
   
* figure out how to schedule note-off events

* Make it work with the ALSA sequencer, instead of (or in addition to?) using
  the raw midi devices like it does now, so the MIDI events can be routed
  around to differnent places.

* Autoconfiscate it.

* Clean up some of the debugging output

* Deleting and Inserting of patterns (the lack of this is not as bad as
  it sounds, since it's measures, not patterns that control which patterns
  get played in what order.)

* Maybe redo the arrangement window as a single large drawing area,
  or figure out how to make selection not so weird, and how to scroll
  horizontally without scrolling the pattern names, and scroll vertically
  without scrolling the stoff at the top.

* export to MIDI file (done)

* make MIDI file use ticks/quarternote and not SMTPE based timing?

* better buttons for the top row of the arrangement window.

* Would like to add hotkeys to the drawing areas for the instruments,
  so that I could position the mouse in *any* instruments area, and then
  press, e.g. the 'b' key and have it place a note at the spot indicated
  for whatever the mouse location was, but in some "default bass drum"
  instrument, likewise, 's' for snare, maybe '1', '2', '3', '4', for toms,
  'c' for crash, etc.  so you could quickly compose using the keyboard to
  select instruments in a random access way, using the mouse to select 
  time and velocity, and in this way select instrument/time/velocity all
  in one keystroke without a lot of needless scrolling around.

  However, I can't figure out how to get the key_press_events into
  the drawing_area.

* Better interfacing with softsynths via JACK, or maybe MIDIshare, or
  possibly embed fluidsynth?    Right now alsa-virmidi works to route
  midi to softsynths.

* Anything else?
