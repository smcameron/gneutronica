* figure out how to schedule note-off events

* Make it work with the ALSA sequencer, instead of (or in addition to?) using
the raw midi devices like it does now, so the MIDI events can be routed
around to differnent places.

* Autoconfiscate it.

* Clean up some of the debugging output

* Deleting and Inserting of patterns (the lack of this is not as bad as
  it sounds, since it's measures, not patterns that control which patterns
  get played in what order.)

* Maybe redo the arrangement window as a single large drawing area,
  or figure out how to make selection not so weird, and how to scroll
  horizontally without scrolling the pattern names, and scroll vertically
  without scrolling the stoff at the top.

* export to MIDI file

* better buttons for the top row of the arrangement window.

* Anything else?
