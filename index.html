<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Gneutronica is a simple MIDI drum machine and rudimentary
sequencer program.
If you are familiar with Hydrogen,
you'll find yourself pretty much at home with Gneutronica.  Gneutronica lets you create 
patterns of melody or drum beats one measure long, allows you to divide up each measure
into however many beats you like (several times simultaneously, if you want)
and then arrange those patterns into a sequence for playback.  Essentially it's
a tool with which to create drum tracks and instrument tracks and play 
them back via MIDI devices.

<p>About a year ago (July 4, 2005), Gneutronica was quite small, less than
3000 lines of code.  Now, nearly a year later, it's about 9000 lines or so.
It's a bit bigger, but still not too huge.  It doesn't try to do
everything, and there are probably some strange things about the user interface
which are due to my lack of knowledge about Gnome programming.  Gneutronica is
my very first Gnome program ever, and it's been probably 8 or 10 years since
the last time I did any sort of X-windows programming at all.  My 
knowledge of MIDI is also rather sketchy.  That could be viewed as good 
news for anyone looking for a project to learn gnome or MIDI programming 
with.  This program is still small and easy to understand.

<p>Having said all that, I think it may have reached the stage of actually being useful,
and it's pretty easy to use, so I thought I'd throw it out there in case anyone
else might be wishing Hydrogen could talk to MIDI devices, or that it had a gnome 
interface.  These two perceived shortcomings of Hydrogen, (at least I considered 
them to be shortcomings,) plus a desire to learn gnome and MIDI programming
are what led me to create Gneutronica.  (By now, the shortcoming of Hydrogen
which I was complaining about may well have been rectified, for all I know.)

<h1>Building and running Gneutronica</h1>
<p>Really easy, has not been "autoconfiscated" or anything, just type make.
<p>You will need the ALSA library), which can be found here:
<a href="http://alsa-project.org/">http://alsa-project.org/</a>, as 
Gneutronica uses the ALSA sequencer interface.
<pre>
[scameron@zuul gneutronica]$ make

<p>If you want Gneutronica to be built with for the French language,
edit the make file and uncomment the GNEUTRONICA_LANGUAGE= line
for French. (The translations aren't very good, they are done 
by machine.)

<p>Change:
<pre>
GNEUTRONICA_LANGUAGE=
# GNEUTRONICA_LANGUAGE=-DGNEUTRONICA_FRENCH
</pre>
to
<pre>
# GNEUTRONICA_LANGUAGE=
GNEUTRONICA_LANGUAGE=-DGNEUTRONICA_FRENCH
</pre>
for French language support.
 
<p>And running it . . .

<h1>(Some ramblings about) Getting Started</h1>
<p>The first thing you need to do to get started with Gneutronica is to get your
MIDI device hooked up to your computer and able to make sound.  I'm going to
assume you've gotten that far.  
I have tried Gneutronica with a Yamaha Motif Rack, connected by USB, and a 
Kurzweil PC88, and a Roland (BOSS) Dr. Rhythm 660 drum machine, the latter two 
connected via USB through an M-audio (or Midiman) MidiSport 2x2 USB to MIDI 
converter.  (Getting the Midisport to work with Fedora core 3 and 4 wasn't too 
bad, the worst part was getting the necessary 
firmware image.)
Many machines assume MIDI channel 9 (or 10?) for percussion presets.
For the machines I've tried (excepting one Roland keyboard)  
you could just set the machine to a percussion preset via its front panel
controls, and then you were at least able to make some sound via the MIDI interface
which corresponded to the front panel settings.  Gneutronica does not currently 
try to send any MIDI program change messages by default, so setting things up 
from the front panel of the device is currently necessary.  (However, there is 
a "Midi Setup" button with the ability to send bank and patch change messages,
but it's not yet well tested, so I'm not completely sure it's all working right.
Eventually it should work.)

<p>Gneutronica will also work with softsynths (e.g: fluidsynth).  Use acconnect
or JACK to connect Gneutronica's midi outputs to your MIDI devices or softsynths.

<p>Once you have your device connected and fired up, you need to start Gneutronica.
By default, it will open the ALSA sequencer and create 16 sequencer 
ports (You can think of those as "tracks" within Gneutronica).  This can be
changed by the "-d" parameter.  When first firing it up you may also wish to 
tell it to use an alternate drum specification file with the -k option.  
There is a General MIDI standard
one which may be useful if you select a GM percussion compatible preset on your machine. 
If not, you may wish to use generic.dk, by specifying "-k drumkits/generic.dk" on
the command line when starting the program.  This drumkit lets you send to all 127 notes 
without trying to guess the names.  Doing this, you can create your own drum 
specification file, which follows a simple format, a bunch of strings of characters, 
seperated by commas.  The first line is used to identify the file format, in case
it changes in the future.  The second line contains the manufacturer, make and 
model, and subsequent lines
specify instrments, with a pair of names, the MIDI note number, and the closest
General MIDI note number for that instrument (for remapping purposes).  The first name
will appear in buttons in Gneutronica, and the second in tooltip windows.   So the
first name should be short enough to fit in a button, and the 2nd may be longer.
<pre>
Gneutronica drumkit file format 1
Manufacture, Model, drumkit name
Instrument 1, description of instrument 1, 1 1 
Instrument 2, description of instrument 2, 2 2
</pre>
<p>However, that is the hard way, as now there is a drumkit editor.  Just click the
"Edit Drum Kit" button on the pattern window, and you should see something like this:
<p align=center><img src="documentation/drumkit_editor.png">
<p>This will allow you to play the instruments by hitting the instrument button,
hear it, and then type in the instrument name, type, MIDI note number, and
approximate GM MIDI note without having to think too hard abuot it.
<p>BTW, if you make a new drumkit file for a new device, or a new preset on a device
send it to me, (stephenmcameron@gmail.com) and I'll include it in the next release.
<h1>Making a pattern</h1>
<p>When you first start up Gneutronica, you are presented with the Pattern Editor window.
In a second tab near the bottom left, is the Arrangement Editor.
The pattern editor lets you construct a pattern of 
drum beats one measure long, and the arrangement editor lets you arrange those one-measure-long 
patterns into a sequence.

<p>Here is the pattern editor:
<p align=center><img src=documentation/pattern_editor.png>
<p>The grid in the center is where the pattern is constructed.  Time runs along
the horizontal axis, and the instruments are on the vertical axis, along the 
left hand side.  The vertical lines divide the measure into time intervals, and
control where notes may be placed.  There are five sets of such lines, but by
default, only two are active, the red lines, and the blue lines.  The red lines
divide the measure into quarters, and the blue lines divide the measure into
16ths.  The divisions are controllable by the numbers in the "spin-boxes" on the
right hand side of the screen.  A value of zero or one essentially makes a set
of lines inactive.  A value of 2 divides the measure in half into 2 equal sized
pieces, a value of 3 divides it into 3rds, 4 into 4ths, 5 into 5ths, etc.  You can divide
the measure all the way down to mincemeat, that is, to 300ths.  Whether
or not your MIDI device and Gneutronica can actually perform a very dense 
measure successfully is another
question though.  And you can
divide it 5 times independently to set up polyrhythms like 3 against 4, or even go
all Chopin with something crazy like 13 against 17 or some even bigger prime 
number

<p>You set up a pattern by clicking in the central grid.  For example, if you
wanted to create a simple backbeat with bass drum on beats 1 and 3 and snare
on 2 and 4, you'd find a bass drum you like, and click next to it on the very 
left hand edge of the central grid (beat 1) and on the middle red line (beat 3)
and click next to the snare drum on the 1st and 3rd red lines (beats 3 and 4).
Easy.  You can listen to your pattern by pressing the "play" button.  Clicking
on the instrument buttons plays the instrument, but does not change the pattern.
Some instruments (whistles) require a MIDI "note-off" message before they
will ever quit making sound.  The "Stop" button is useful if you hit one of
those.  Right now Gneutronica generally doesn't send "note-off" messages.   (Yeah,
that's a bug.)

<p><b>Controlling the volume of notes:</b>  There are several ways of controlling
the volume of notes placed in the grid.  When using the left mouse button to place
notes, the height above the line for each instrument controls the volume.  So if 
you click very close to the horizontal line for an instrument, the note will be
very quiet, and the further above the line you click, the louder the note will be.
Changing the volume of already placed notes is as easy as clicking on the note
a little bit higher, or lower to raise or lower the volume for that note.
Since MIDI note volume (velocity, more precisely) has a range of 0-127, this 
method of setting the volume, though while quite convenient, is not as precise
as one might one, since the area of pixels in which you click the mouse is only
about 30 pixels high, you don't get the full 0-127 values, but only a
down-sampled 30 values.  There is a "Volume Zoom" feature which allows you
to expand the height of the area for the current instrument by a preset
amount.  Using this, you get the same convenience of single-click
placement of notes in both time and velocity, and you get the needed 
precision, and as each instrument is automatically expanded and contracted
as you place notes, you still get to see plenty of instruments onscreen 
at once.  Explaining it is more difficult than using, if you just move the
"Volume Zoom" slider around and watch the screen, and click on a few notes,
you'll immediately see how it works.


<p><b>To delete a note,</b> click on it with the right or middle mouse buttons.
You can also use the "Clear" button that's next to each instrument to delete 
all the notes for that instrument in that pattern. This button
will only be visible if the "Hide Instrument Attributes" checkbox is not checked.

<p>There is another way to control the volume of notes.  There is a volume
slider to the left of each instrument.  This sets a default volume.  Whenever
you place a note on the grid by using the middle mouse button, this default
volume will be used.  If you wish to place a series of notes with a uniform
volume, the way to do it is to set the volume with the slider, then place
all the notes on the grid with the middle mouse button.

<p>The "Beats per Minute" controls the tempo of single-pattern playback (but not
the tempo of the pattern within a song, which is controllable measure by measure,
and a pattern may appear in more than one measure).  The "Beats per Measure" affects
the pattern in both single-pattern playback and within the context of the song.  It
is essentially a way for you to tell Gneutronica how many beats you consider the
pattern to contain, regardless of what notes are actually in the pattern, or how
they are arranged.

<p>the "Next" and "previous" pattern buttons allow the pattern editor to 
travers the list of patterns you will create as you make a song.  You can
name your patterns by entering whatever text you like (but not single quotes)
in the "Pattern" field.  The "Hide unchecked instruments" box allows you to 
reduce the size of the list of instruments.  Typically a pattern, or even a song
will use just a few instruments, but the drumkits typically contain very many
instruments, which can lead to a lot of superflous scrolling around.  By checking
the boxes next to the instruments you are actually using, and checking the "Hide
unchecked instruments" box, you can reduce this scrolling.

<p>Some additional features are available if the "Hide Instrument Attributes"
checkbox is not checked.  In that case, there will be a "spinbox" at the
extreme left hand side of each instrument row in the pattern window.  This
controls "drag" or "rushing" of an instrument.  You set the percentage of
a beat you wish the instrument to "drag" behind the "correct" time.  If you
use a negative number, you get negative drag, or, rushing, the instrument 
will play "too soon," compared to correct time.
<p>Next to the drag control is the default volume control, a simple slider
which sets the default volume for notes.  (See more above about setting
the volume of notes.)  After the default volume control is a button to
clear all the notes of that instrument from a pattern.

<p>The <b>Remap Drum Kit</b> button is useful only if you have loaded
a song from a file which was originallly created with a different
drumkit.  This button causes the instruments in the pattern to be
remapped using General MIDI mappings as a common denominator.  This
will sometimes give a decent approximation, but is unlikely to be
a completely satisfactory mapping.  It's a good way to get a first
approximation of a remapping which can then be tweaked by hand.

<p>There are now some hotkeys.  'q' quits gneutronica and saves
your file in /tmp/zzz.gdt.

<p>Additionally there are some hotkeys meant to help with swapping
out instruments.  Suppose you like a song, but want to swap out
the snare drum sound for another.  One way would be to edit the
drumkit file and change the snare drum sound in there without
changing any of your patterns.  But you may not want to have song
specific drumkits lying around.

<p>These hotkeys are best used with automag turned on, and volume
zoom set so you can see which is the "current" instrument easily.

<ul>
<li>'c' marks the current instrument for later copy operations.
<li>'p' copies the hits from the instrument previously marked by 'c'
to the current instrument for the current pattern.
<li>'x' clears the current instrument for the current pattern.
<li>'P' cycles through all the patterns in a song, and copies 
     the hits from the instrument previously marked with 'c'
     to the current instrument for each pattern.
<li>'X' cycles through all the patterns in a song, and clears 
     the current instrument for each pattern. 
<li>'J' transposes melodic patterns up one semitone
<li>'K' transposes melodic patterns down one semitone
</ul>

So for instance, to swap out a snare drum sound SNARE1 with 
a new sound, SNARE2, you'd do the following:

<ol>
<li>Turn on automag and move the volume zoom slider a bit to the right.
<li>Move the mouse over the SNARE1 row, and press 'c'.
<li>Move the mouse over the SNARE2 row, and press 'P' (shift p to get
whole song, lowercase p for just this pattern.)
<li>Move the mouse over the SNARE1 row, and press 'X' (shift X for
the whole song, lowercase x for just this pattern.)
</ol>

<p>There is also a rudimentary melodic sequencer in Gneutronica now:
<p align=center><img src="documentation/pattern_editor1.png">
<p><b>Track:</b> this controls which ALSA sequencer port Gneutronica
will transmit this pattern to.  Typically, you might have a bunch of
drum patterns going out to say, a drum machine, you caould assign all
those to Track 0, and use aconnect, or JACK to connect this sequencer
port to the appropriate MIDI device or softsynth (your drum machine.)
Then you might have, say, a bass part, and wish to sound that to a 
different sound module or softsynth, so you set those bass patterns to
track 1, and again, use aconnect or JACK to assign that sequencer port
to the appropriate device or softsynth.

<p><b>Channel:</b>If you have separate parts, say, a bass part, and a 
drum part, you may wish to send both parts to the same device or softsynth,
but to different instruments on that device.  Typically this is done with
MIDI channels, on the device or softsynth, you arrange one instrument to
receive on on channel, and another instrument to receive on another 
channel.  Then you arrange your patterns in Gneutronica to transmit on
the appropriate channel.

<h1>Arranging patterns into a song</h1>
<p>Here is the arranger window:
<p align=center><img src="documentation/arranger_window.png">
<p>The idea is you have all your patterns lined up in a column on the left, and 
a grid representing what measures are played in what sequence on the right.
Each column in the grid represents one measure, and you click in the square
next to each pattern which is to be played in any given measure.  You can
toggle multiple measures by clicking and dragging across several measures
with the left mouse button.
<p>Notice that you can have more than one pattern playing
in a given measure.  For example if I wanted to add a ride cymbal
to a sequence of patterns in the 2nd half of the song, I could make a pattern
called "ride" which would contain only the ride cymbal.  Then I could
superimpose this pattern over my previous backbeat patterns by just
clicking boxes in the Arrangement editor.  Of course
you don't have to do things this way, you could just as easily copied all
the patterns to new patterns and modified each pattern to add ride cymbal to 
it.  And in fact this is even easier than it sounds, as in the pattern 
window the "Paste" button really superimposes a selected pattern onto the 
pattern currently being edited, so you could create a pattern with only 
ride cymbal, then create new patterns by copying old patterns and then
using the paste button to superimpose the ride cymbal pattern into those
new patterns.  There are lots of different ways of working.

<p>The "<b>Tempo changes</b>" buttons above each measure allow you to set changes in
tempo at measure boundaries.. When pressed, a window pops up that lets you
specify a new tempo in beats per minute which takes effect at the beginning
of the measure corresponding to the button you pressed, and which remains in effect until
the next tempo change you specify.  There is always at least one tempo "change" at 
the beginning of the first measure, specifyhing the initial tempo.  Tempo changes 
can also be deleted if you change your mind, by using the same buttons.
<p>The "<b>Select measures</b>" button will select all measures, or unselect all measures
if any are already selected.  Additionally, clicking on the buttons to the
right of the "Select" button will select individual measures.  Or, if you
click on one of those buttons, then drag to another button before releasing,
you can select multiple measures.  You can also use the right mouse button
and click and drag in the measures boxes (beside the pattern name buttons)
to select multiple measures.
<p>The "<b>Delete measures</b>" button will delete selected measures.  Or, selecting the
individual buttons to the right of the "Delete" button will delete 
single measures.
<p>The "<b>Insert measures</b>" button will insert blank measures for however many measures 
are currently selected directly before the selection.  The individual buttons
to the right will insert single blank measures.
<p>The "Paste" buttons will insert copies of whatever measures are currently
selected.
<p>The "<b>Sel</b>" button will select the pattern it's to which it is adjacent,
this selection is later used by the "Paste" button in the pattern editor
window.
<p>The "<b>Ins</b>" pattern button inserts a new blank pattern jsut
above the pattern to which it's adjacent.
<p>The "<b>Del</b>" button will delete the pattern to which it's adjacent,
and remove any instances of this pattern in any measures in which it
occurs.
<p>The buttons which contain the pattern names will cause the pattern 
editor window to jump to that pattern, which is convenient for navigating
(rather than pressing "<b>Next Pattern</b>" or 
"<b>Previous Pattern</b>" pattern buttons repeatedly to
scroll through them all.

<h2>Saving and Loading songs and patterns</h2>
<p>Under the <b>File</b> menu in the arranger window, you will
find the following options:
<ul>
<li><b>Open</b>: Loads an existing Gneutronica song file into memory.  The current
song is discarded from memory.
<li><b>Save</b>: Save the current song to a file.
<li><b>Save As</b>: Save the current song to a file. (Right now, "Save As" and "Save" 
are pretty much identical.)
<li><b>Import Patterns</b>:  This allows you to load just the patterns from an existing
song, but not the arrangement.  It does not discard the current song, it just adds the
patterns fron another song to the current song.  In order for this to work perfectly,
the drumkits the two songs use must be the same, or at least similar in that they have
instruments sharing the same roles in the same locations in the drum kit.  If the drumkits
are not the same, the imported pattern will try to use General MIDI mappings to reassign
instruments from kit used in the song file to the kit currently in use in the running
program.
<li><b>Export song to MIDI File</b> Exports the song to the simplest possible 
form of a MIDI file.
</ul>
<p>Under the <b>Edit</b> menu, there is one item, <b>Remap drum kit for whole song via GM</b>.
If you start gneutronica with one drum kit, and load a song that was saved with a different
drum kit, there is the possibility to use General MIDI mappings to try to reassign the
instruments to appropriate roles for the drumkit in use.  This menu item causes gneutronica
to attempt such a mapping for every pattern in the song.

<h2>Some miscelaneous features:</h2>
<a name="tablature">
<h3>Import ASCII drum tablature</h3></a>
<p>This is one of the coolest new features I've added in a
while.  There are a couple of selections in the "File" menu
which will allow you to import aSCII drum tabs from a file,
which is pretty straightforward.

<p>You can also select drum tabs with the mouse, then
paste them into the arranger window with the middle
mouse button.

<p>If you hear a "Cuica" (whatever that is) during
playback, that's the instrument that Gneutronica uses
when it can't figure out what it should use.

For instance, you can paste this in, and for the question
mark instruments, you'll hear the Cuica, which sounds a little
bit like someone saying "huh?".  That's just so
you can know that Gneutronica couldn't figure out what to
do, so you can teach Gneutronica about this unknown instrument,
or, fix your tab file if it's just using some
notation which gneutronica doesn't grok.

<p>Some sample drum tab you can try pasting.
<pre>
Hh|x-------x-------|x-------x-------|x-------x-------|x-------x-------|
hc|--x-x-x---x-x-x-|--x---x---x---x-|--x-x-x---x-x-x-|--x---x---x---x-|
sd|----x-------x---|----x-------x---|----x-------x---|----x-------x---|

sd|----x-------x---|---xx-------x---|
bd|x-------x-------|x-x-----x-------|
? |x---------------|x---------------|
</pre>

<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to edit the tab file a little
bit to get gneutronica to understand it (some complicated things,
it may never be able to get.)  Lot of times, stray vertical bar
characters, or extra spacing inside the measures and so on can
throw it off.  Lots of times the file will just go right in, but
when it doesn't, more often than not, a few moments editing the
file in vi will make it usable.

<p>In addition to pasting with the middle mouse button, there is
a "Paste" menu item.  The difference is that the middle mouse
button pastes whatever is in the current selection, and the menu
item pastes whatever has been copied to the clipboard.  The
"current selection" is more transient than the clipboard selection.
(See <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/x-cut-and-paste.html">
X Selections, Cut Buffers, and Kill Rings.  </a> by Jamie
Zawinski for a thorough explanation of the difference.  It
boils down to the idea that X has two different ways to copy
and paste.)

<h3>Scramble</h3>
<p>The Scramble button randomly scrambles the current
pattern.  It is intended to be used as an aid in composition.
The scrambling uses the first time division spin box, and divides
the measure into that many equal sized chunks, and then shuffles
the chunks.  Sometimes dividing a measure up into 4 equal size
chunks and then scrambling those chunks can give interesting
results.
<h3><b>Add space before</b> and <b>Add space after</b></h3>
These two buttons allow you to add extra space at the beginning
and the ending of the measure, respectively.  Suppose you're
composing some drum beat to go along with some guitar part
and you find out that it needs to be a bit longer.  Say
instead of the 16 equal sized chunks, you wanted 19
equal sized chunks.  So you want to add 3/19 more
space onto the end.  Set the numerator to 3, the
denominator to 19, and click "Add space after."
The notes are all shoved over to the left proportionally,
leaving you an extra 3/19's of a measure of blank space.
You can then adjust the grid lines to match your new
spacing.
<p>When adding space, set the numerator and denominator
to indicate what fraction of the total measure <em>after
the operation</em> you want the added space to consume.
<p>For example, if you have a measure 2 units long, and
want to make it instead 3 units long by adding some space
onto the end, set the numerator and denominator to 1 and
3, or 1/3.  In other words, after the space is added,
the new space will occupy 1/3 of the total length of
the measure.
<h3><b>Remove space before</b> and <b>Remove space after</b></h3>
<p>These buttons remvoe a fraction of the measure from the
beginning or end.  If you want to cut off the first quarter
of a measure, set the numerator/denominator to 1/4, then
press "Remove space before."  If you want to cut off the last
1/3rd of a measure, set the numerator/denominator to 1/3
and press "Remove space after."  When removing space, the
fraction used is the fraction of the measure <em>before
the operation</em>, which is different than what's done
for adding space.
<p><b>Splitting patterns</b>
<p>Suppose you want to split a pattern into two
equal sized patterns.
<ol>
<li>Duplicate the pattern, say "A" into a second pattern, say "B",
using the select and paste buttons.
<li>Cut off the back half of "A" by using "Remove space after"
with the fraction set to 1/2.
<li>Cut off the front half of "B" by using "Remove space before"
and the fraction set to 1/2.  The splitting has now been accomplished.
</ol>
<p><b>Joining patterns</b>
<p>Suppose you want to join two patterns into a single pattern.
<ol>
<li>Start with two patterns, "A" and "B".
<li>Edit pattern "A", and use "Add space after"
with the fractino set to 1/2.
<li>Edit pattern "B" and use "Add space before"
with the fraction set to 1/2.
<li>Select pattern "B"
<li>Paste into pattern A.  Now pattern "A" contains
the original "A" as the front half, and the original
"B" as the back half.
<li>Delete pattern "B"  The patterns are now joined.
</ol>



<h2>Using Gneutronica with softsynths such as fluidsynth</h2>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>
<b>Note -- this section is mostly obsolete, unless you fiddle
with gneutronica.c and make "midi = midi_raw;" instead of 
"midi = midi_alsa;".  But, you wouldn't do that.  Ignore

The lines beginning with "hw:2..." are my virtual midi devices, and
the '2' means it's the 3rd device (0 and 1 are the 1st and 2nd).  This
matches the 2 in /dev/snd/midiC2D0

my running softsynth.
<li>Connect one of the virtual raw MIDI ports to the software
synth.  In this case, I'm going to connect client 80
(which is /dev/snd/midiC2D0) to client 128 (the softsynth).

clients 80,81,82,and 83 are the virtual midi devices and correspond
to /dev/snd/midiC2D0, /dev/snd/midiC2D1, /dev/snd/midiC2D2, 
and /dev/snd/midiC2D3, respectively.  The idea is you connect
one of these nodes up to the input of the fluid synth, then
let gneutronica send to this node, and it will get routed to
the softsynth.
<li>Now, start Gneutronica so as to send MIDI to the 
virtual midi device corresponding to client 80. (/dev/snd/midiC2D0)

<pre>
[scameron@zuul ~]$ gneutronica -d /dev/snd/midiC2D0
</pre>

Now, gneutronica should be driving the softsynth, just use it as
you normally would.
</ol>
<h2>Using Gneutronica with MIDI input devices</h2>
Invoke gneutronica with the '-i' option, specifying the device
file for your MIDI input device.  I have tried this with an Akai
MPD16 drumpad through an M-Audio Midisport 2x2 USB to MIDI converter.
(Though the Akai has a USB port, it does not appear to work with
linux just yet.  I have had some progress in making the driver
work with the Akai's USB port, but not total success yet, so for
now, the Midisport is required for the Akai.  Other devices obviouly
may work better.)

<p>Use the Metronome and Loop check boxes in the Pattern window in
conjunction with the record button to tap in patterns with your
MIDI input device.  The first set of time division lines also controls
the Metronome.  (Note:  If the '-i' option is not used to specify an
input device, the "Record" button will not be present.)

<p><b>Some things Gneutronica doesn't do</b>

<ul>
<li>Interconnect with Jack.  (I don't really know if it even makes sense for a MIDI app.)
<li>Import MIDI files.  
<li>... probably some other stuff.
</ul>

<p><b>BUGS:</b> You betcha.  It uses and abuses fscanf() for one thing...  For 
another, it doesn't generally send any "Note off" messages during normal
playback.

<p><b>Some notes about v. 0.27</b> 
<p>This version changes the file format of both the drumkit files and the song
files slightly.  The program should still read the old files, however the GM
remapping of instruments won't work right.  

<p>First, you should upgrade your drumkit files.  If you've used the standard
ones that came with gneutronica, then 0.27 comes with new versions of these
drumkit files.  If you have your own custom drumkit files you should start
gneutronica then "edit drumkit" and put in values for the General MIDI 
values for each instrument, then save the drumkit.

<p>To get your old song files be
saved in the new format, you should start gneutronica with the -k option
to specify whichever drumkit file you used for a song.  You should
use the new version of the drumkit file which contains the General
MIDI mappings.  Then open the song and then save it.  This will save 
it with the new GM mappings, which will enable you to remap the song
to use another drumkit if you need to at some point.
